Called prior to a push to a remote. In addition to the parameters, additional information, separated by a space is passed in through stdin in the form of “<local ref> <local sha1> <remote ref> <remote sha1>”. Parsing the input can get you additional information that you can use to check. For instance, if the local sha1 is 40 zeros long, the push is a delete and if the remote sha1 is 40 zeros, it is a new branch. This can be used to do many comparisons of the pushed ref to what is currently there. A non-zero exit status aborts the push.
