This hook is invoked with the environment variable GIT_EDITOR=: if the command will not bring up an editor to modify the commit message.

If the merge cannot be carried out automatically, the conflicts need to be resolved and the result committed separately (see git-merge[1]). At that point, this hook will not be executed, but the pre-commit hook will, if it is enabled.
