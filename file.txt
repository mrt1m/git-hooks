pre-merge-commit
This hook is invoked by git-merge[1], and can be bypassed with the --no-verify option. It takes no parameters, and is invoked after the merge has been carried out successfully and before obtaining the proposed commit log message to make a commit. Exiting with a non-zero status from this script causes the git merge command to abort before creating a commit.

The default pre-merge-commit hook, when enabled, runs the pre-commit hook, if the latter is enabled.
